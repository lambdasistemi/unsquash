# unsquash Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Iterative Unfolding

The algorithm works from the periphery to the center. Pure additions are extracted first (zero conflict risk), then internal rewrites (same API), then API changes (with callsite fallout), then deletions (always last). Each iteration shrinks the remaining diff. The compile oracle validates every unfolded commit.

### II. Mechanical Before Semantic

Hunk classification is mechanical wherever possible: pure additions, pure deletions, and unchanged-signature body edits can be identified by diff analysis alone. LLM is only invoked for semantic questions: "did this function's API change?", "which callsite hunks belong to this signature change?", "what's the dependency order?"

### III. Pluggable Components

Three pluggable axes:
- **LLM CLI** — any tool that accepts a prompt on stdin and returns structured output. No hardcoded API.
- **Compile oracle** — pluggable per language (GHC, cargo, go build, etc.). The oracle is the correctness proof.
- **VCS** — git for now, but the diff parsing should not assume git internals beyond unified diff format.

### IV. Babashka Orchestration

Babashka owns all state: the diff, the patch sets, the iteration loop, the git operations. The LLM never touches git directly. Babashka calls the LLM CLI as a function: context in, structured JSON out.

### V. Compile-Validated Commits

Every unfolded commit must compile when prepended to the remaining stack. If it doesn't compile, the extraction was wrong — either too much or too little was extracted. The tool retries by adjusting the hunk assignment (LLM-assisted if needed). Deletions are exempt from compile checks (they're always last).

## Commit Discipline

- **StGit** for all commit management during development
- Each commit addresses a single concern
- Conventional Commits format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`
- History is for the reviewer, not the author — no fixup commits, no WIP noise
- When working with the AI assistant: always squash on merge, keep PRs focused on one concern

## Development Workflow

- **Nix-first**: `flake.nix` provides all build tools, CI and local use the same shell
- **PR-only**: never push directly to main
- **Local CI before push**: `just ci` must pass before pushing
- **Branch naming**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- **Worktrees**: one branch per worktree, main stays on main
- **Labels and assignment**: every PR labeled and assigned
- **Linear history**: rebase merge on main

## Quality Gates

- All unfolded commits must pass the compile oracle (except trailing deletions)
- Hunk classification must be deterministic for mechanical categories
- LLM prompts must have defined JSON schemas for responses
- The tool must fail loudly on unclassifiable hunks rather than silently misclassify

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation and user approval.
